# Rasp-Pi-Hosts
This is a private collection of merges host lists from all over which can be used as a central point for Pi-Hole.
Due to the nature of hosts updates, this list may be wildly out of date.
With this in mind, this is mainly just a copy of certain hosts which aren't regularly updated, but which could disappear due to neglect or deletion.
